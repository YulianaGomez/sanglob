About
----------------------
Testing different streaming capabilities of globus web services, GUC, and ZMQ.
Developing an app where any one of the three can be called to initiate a
transfer.

----------------------
Required to run:
----------------------
Globus*: https://www.globus.org/
ZMQ: http://zeromq.org/area:download

*Certain adjustments can be made to simulate streaming with
globus if sandbox isn't public yet. Otherwise, download Globus Sandbox
if available.

----------------------
Files
----------------------
|--globus_sandbox.py        Uses globus with streaming enabled
|--setup_client             Sets up environment to change client ID and setting
                            conda environment
|--commands_cham            List of commands specific for chameleon environment


----------------------
Transfers with globus sandbox
----------------------
Make sure you put your client id in setup_client file. Client id can be found in
https://developers.globus.org/
You will need to have globus connected at both the endpoints(source/destination)
you want to transfer from/to.

Sample command:  python globus_sandbox.py 55705028-aa15-11e7-bdad-22000bdb2406

The second argument is the destination endpoint. The source endpoint is set under
the variable source_endpoint_id in globus_sandbox.py. Files in specified directory
are transferred, script waits a specified time for more files to enter directory,
until a max time is reached or run is stopped.
